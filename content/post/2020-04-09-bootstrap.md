Ok, let's start! 
It is some time now since I first though to start a blog, but I always posponed it. I was not sure about the topic to focus on, and 
more in general I always found some excuse to push back. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the constrinction to spend
so much time at home with myself I decided that there are no more excuses that holds. 
Regarding the focus of the blog I'm not sure yet, I guess we will find out along the way. However, the idea is to collect
some thoughts and considerations that may be interesting for other others to read.  

Ah right, regarding my nickname -- Mr. V -- it is a homage to the Mr. Robot tv sierie, I loved it a lot. 
My real identity is not really important, I'm just a simple software engineer (although not as good or troubled as Elliot).
You can call me Mr. V :)
